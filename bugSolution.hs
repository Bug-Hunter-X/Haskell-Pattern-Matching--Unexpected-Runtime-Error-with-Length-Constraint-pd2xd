The solution addresses the issue by handling cases where the input list has fewer than three elements. Here's how it can be fixed:

```haskell
func :: [Int] -> Int
func (x:y:z:rest) | length (x:y:z:rest) == 3 = x + y + z  --Guard to check length
func _ = 0
```

Alternatively, you can add more patterns to handle lists of different lengths:

```haskell
func :: [Int] -> Int
func (x:y:z:_) = x + y + z
func (x:y:[]) = x + y
func (x:[]) = x
func [] = 0
```

Both methods ensure that the function handles all possible input scenarios gracefully, preventing runtime exceptions.
