This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a list with an explicit length constraint, but it doesn't handle the case where the input list is shorter than expected. This can lead to a runtime exception if the input list doesn't meet the constraint.

```haskell
func :: [Int] -> Int
func (x:y:z:[]) = x + y + z
func _ = 0
```
